The Graphics Office designs for exhibitions and print. We give visual and verbal form to an idea, a notion, a sensibility, a group of facts. Design is an important part of every project we do—but it’s not the only part. We believe that a larger understanding of subject, history, context, and audience should drive graphic solutions. A fascination with type—not only trends, but the details of typesetting and the history of metal and wood type—informs our work. Both of us have set type by hand and printed on antique treadle presses. In fact, we wrote and designed [a book](http://thegraphicsoffice.com/the-handy-book-of-artistic-printing/ "THE HANDY BOOK OF ARTISTIC PRINTING") together on historic type and printing which won an award in the Type Directors Club annual competition. Our writing has also been published in magazines and blogs, and we bring to any work we do a sense of how it sounds and reads, and where it fits in the cultural landscape. TGO would like to help you meet your goals in the smartest, most attractive way possible. Please get in touch.
