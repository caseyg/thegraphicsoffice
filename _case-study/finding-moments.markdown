description: One of the most exciting parts of any project is finding details, ideas,
  or key elements to highlight. In each case we think of this as finding a punctuation
  point, a choice or series of choices that convey something compelling, unexpectedly
  familiar or strange, but always emotionally resonant.

    ## *Minutes to Midtown* exhibition, New York Transit Museum

    A curator’s sidebar text on the history of industry in Queens seemed abstract. Further research revealed that Queens has been the origin and home of many great American companies. Why not design a “Made in Queens” wall of logos and include some vintage packaging?

    ## *Shelley’s Ghost* exhibition, New York Public Library

    In an effort to engage visitors with the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley’s ideas, and to help fulfill the brief to design a dynamic and dramatic exhibition, we suggested four keepsake cards to be made available free of charge in the gallery. We printed the cards letterpress on thick paper and distributed them from a vintage library card catalog drawer.

    ## Rubenstein corporate history wall

    While designing a display for this prominent public relations firm with a long history, we sifted through scores of vintage company photos and artifacts. One thing stood out: a collection of founder’s vintage A–Z Rolodexes. We had them photographed and featured prominently on the final wall. History, connections, and influence compressed into one shot.
