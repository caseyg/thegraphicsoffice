description: When we recognize quality in something overlooked or relatively insignificant,
  we find it immensely satisfying to shape and share it in a contemporary form. Sometimes
  the impulse derives from a desire to reanimate history; sometimes from the need
  to add drama to a design.

  text: "## *B de B* chapbook prints\n\n\nThe line of alphabet prints we call “B.
    de B.” are sourced from a 19th-century scrapbook of children’s chapbook pages
    that we bought at an antiques fair. We combined images and letters from the album,
    supplemented the missing letters, and created a completely new set of prints. "

    to Kansas resulted in a series of onsite gravestone rubbings of the word “DIED.”
    This design combines them into one print that is a catalog of mourning lettering
    in America in the 19th century. \n"

    ## Rubenstein corporate history wall

    While designing a display for a prominent public relations firm with a long history, we sifted through scores of vintage company photos and artifacts. One thing stood out: a collection of founder’s vintage A–Z Rolodexes. We had them photographed and featured prominently on the final wall. History, connections, and influence compressed into one shot.
