When we recognize quality in something overlooked or taken for granted, we find it immensely satisfying to shape and share it in a contemporary form. Sometimes the impulse derives from a desire to reanimate history; sometimes from the need to add drama to a design.

## B. de B. alphabet prints

The line of prints we call “B. de B.” are sourced from a nineteenth-century scrapbook of children’s chapbook pages that we bought at an antiques fair. We selected images and letters from the album, created missing letters and images, and created a set of bold prints.
 
## *Printing Women* exhibition, New York Public Library

The text panels for an exhibition on historic female printers were printed on thick, soft paper and then blind embossed to resemble printing plate impressions. This historical touch, combined with the modern image croppings on the panels, enlivened the usually functional panels in the hallway exhibition.
 
## Bowne & Co. Stationery products

The South Street Seaport Museum in New York City owns a largely unknown collection of nineteenth-century type and images at its antique letterpress shop, Bowne & Co. We designed and printed cards and posters with the collection that were sold in the shop.
