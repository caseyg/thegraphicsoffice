This exhibition described the arc of this fabled gateway from brilliant technological achievement to white elephant, from urban renewal disaster to its possible 21st-century renaissance. We designed the title, color scheme, and all graphic panels. We found the images and created the large wall murals to transform the museumâ€™s narrow gallery annex in Grand Central Terminal.
