The New York Public Library’s Print Collection organizes exhibitions of their distinguished holdings in the Library’s third floor corridors. For <i>Sublime</i>, a selection of 18th and 19th century landscapes, we chose a stark and modern typographic treatment rather than a traditional historical approach, and highlighted the works with a regal unexpected purple. The exhibition, comparing two artists, extended along two corridors. The exhibition’s introduction subtly echoed this division, featuring a J.M.W. Turner landscape mural spanning two bays. (See our other work for the Library, <a title="Shelley’s Ghost: The After-Life of a Poet" href="/portfolio/shelleys-ghost-the-after-life-of-a-poet/">Shelley’s Ghost</a>)
