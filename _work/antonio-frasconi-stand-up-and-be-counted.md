Purchase College honored renowned printmaker and former faculty member Antonio Frasconi with several campus exhibitions. The exhibition title at the School of Art+Design reflected Frasconi’s main subject, social justice. We designed a mailer and a two-sided poster on thin newsprint. The newsprint’s transparencey allowed a multitude of faces to peer through the schedule on the other side.
