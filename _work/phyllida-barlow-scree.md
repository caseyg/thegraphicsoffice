British artist Phyllida Barlow’s work is bold, tactile, layered. The Des Moines Art Center needed to document their exhibition of Barlow’s work with a publication that featured generous installation photography, as well as an interview and extensive artist information. We wanted the book to impart a sense of the work. We used differing paper stocks for photography and for the texts and custom mixed ink in a salmon color pulled from the work. The softcover book was left slightly floppy and stitched down the middle with orange and brown thread, the ends loose and untrimmed.
