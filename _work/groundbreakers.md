The New York Botanical Garden library is one of the largest libraries of botanical materials in the world. Treasures from its collections are featured in ambitious gallery exhibitions in the Gardenâ€™s grand administrative building in the Bronx. <i>Groundbreakers: Gardens for a Beautiful America</i> told stories of pioneering women landscape designers, gardeners, and writers. We chose wall colors and designed didactic panels, labels, a banner, large wall prints, and the exhibition catalog.
