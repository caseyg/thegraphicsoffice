We designed the installation and catalog for an exhibition of works from the library of Bunny Mellon—collector, patron of the arts, and avid gardener. We tried to evoke Mellon’s simple, approachable, yet elegant personal style, using her favorite colors, and even the pattern from the end papers of one of her publications. We incorporated live topiary trees, a Mellon gardening signature, into the display.
