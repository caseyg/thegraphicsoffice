<h1>SEAN KELLY GALLERY | ANTHONY McCALL</h1>
<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
<p>Sean Kelly Gallery approached us to design an extensive catalog raisonné of British conceptual artist Anthony McCall’s works on paper from the 1970s. The final publication is clean and rigorous. Paper tone and all the nuances of the original art are matched exactingly and all works and information are ordered both thematically and chronologically. After an extended gestation with galleries in New York, London and Berlin, Walter Koenig publishers (Germany) delivered it and it weighed in at 310 pages.</p>
