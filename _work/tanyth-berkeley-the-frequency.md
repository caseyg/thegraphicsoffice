Tanyth Berkeleyâ€™s photographs isolate faces from a stream of passersby through Times Square; the reflective cover captures the random reader. Published in a limited edition for a solo exhibition at Bellwether Gallery, Chelsea. (See our <a href=" http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/bellwether-gallery">other work</a> for Bellwether.)
