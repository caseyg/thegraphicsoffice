We created a variety of fundraising materials, themed gala invitations and retail items for the museum using images from their collection. (See the two books we designed for the museum, <a href=" http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/what-might-have-been/"><em>What Might Have Been</em></a> and <a href="http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/a-tenement-story/"><em>A Tenement Story</em></a>.)
