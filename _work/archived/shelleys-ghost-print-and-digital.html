<h1>SHELLEY’S GHOST</h1>
<h3>GRAPHIC DESIGN | WEB DESIGN</h3>
This exhibition of the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley brought together materials from the New York Public Library and the Bodleian Library in Oxford, England. In addition to our collaboration with Barbara Suhr on all aspects of <a href="http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/shelleys-ghost-the-after-life-of-a-poet/">installation design</a>, we created print materials, signage and letterpress-printed mementoes.<span style="font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman;"> In addition, we </span> proposed a curated digital “readers shelf” of Shelley’s works.
