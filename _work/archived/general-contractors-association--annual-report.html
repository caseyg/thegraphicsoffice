<h1 class="p1">General Contractors Association 2014 Annual Report</h1>
<h3 class="p2">GRAPHIC DESIGN | IMAGE RESEARCH | WRITING</h3>
<p class="p2">Happy with our design for their<a title="General Contrators Association of New York" href="/portfolio/general-contractors-association-of-new-york/"><span class="s1"> previous Annual Report</span></a>, the GCA wanted the same dramatic language and bold typography for 2014. We wrote the message on the cover—which set the tone for the report—and edited all the text, which emphasized the dire state of New York City’s infrastructure.
