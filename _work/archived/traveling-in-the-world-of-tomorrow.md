<h3 class="p2">EXHIBITION DESIGN | GRAPHIC DESIGN | IMAGE RESEARCH</h3>
<p class="p2">The New York Transit Museum asked us to help create an exhibit to mark the 50th and 75th anniversaries of the New York World’s Fairs. Displayed in the museum’s Grand Central Terminal annex gallery and shop, the exhibit needed structure and dynamism to compete with the visual clutter of the narrow awkward space. We divided the gallery on a long diagonal, keeping sightlines to the back, and used contrasting color palettes for the 1939 and 1964 fairs. The whole was ringed with a silver object rail to display artifacts and labels.
