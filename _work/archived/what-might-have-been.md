<h1>WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN,<br />
AN IRISH FAMILY AT 97 ORCHARD STREET</h1>
<h3>BOOK DESIGN | RESEARCH</h3>
This second publication for the Lower East Side Tenement Museum marked the debut of the museum’s re-created Irish apartment, and is sold in the museum’s shop. <span>The book, made on a limited budget, conjures the Irish presence in New York’s Lower East Side through sensitive typography and a mix of imaginative photo-illustrations and image selection.</span> This is an example of our favorite kinds of projects, ones that allow us to combine research and design ingenuity to tell stories.
