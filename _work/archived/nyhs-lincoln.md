<h3>graphic design | image research | illustration</h3>
<span style="font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman;">Coordinated by noted scholar Harold Holzer, this complex exhibition at the New-York Historical Society traced the influential role of New York in establishing Abraham Lincoln as a viable presidential candidate and illustrated Lincoln’s indelible mark on the city’s history. </span><span>Working with the Society’s in-house exhibitions team, we researched and designed the show's graphic and typographic elements including photomurals, banners, and a selection of maps, charts, and panels.</span><br />
