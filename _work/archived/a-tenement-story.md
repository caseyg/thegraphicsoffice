<h1>A TENEMENT STORY</h1>
<h3>BOOK DESIGN | RESEARCH</h3>
<span>The signature publication for the Lower East Side Tenement Museum tells the story of the museum’s founding and mission but also evokes the lives and voices of 97 Orchard Street</span>. Angela’s strong interest in New York City history led to our work with the museum— to research images, gather contemporary descriptions, and help edit the text. This won an AIGA communication graphics award and is sold in the museum’s shop.
