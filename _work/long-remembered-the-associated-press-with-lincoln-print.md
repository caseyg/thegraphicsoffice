The Associated Press with Lincoln at the First Inaugural and Gettysburg

The Associated Press regularly exhibits historic materials from its Corporate Archiv</span>es. We were asked to design the booklet and <a href="http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/long-remembered-ap-lincoln/">panels</a> for this traveling exhibition that showcased the AP's coverage of some of Lincolnâ€™s most famous speeches including his First Inaugural Address and the Gettysburg Address.
