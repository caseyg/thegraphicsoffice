Coordinated by noted scholar Harold Holzer, this complex exhibition at the New-York Historical Society traced the influential role of New York in establishing Abraham Lincoln as a viable presidential candidate and illustrated Lincoln’s indelible mark on the city’s history. Working with the Society’s in-house exhibitions team, we researched and designed the show's graphic and typographic elements including photomurals, banners, and a selection of maps, charts, and panels.
