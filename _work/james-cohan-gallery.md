The James Cohan Gallery shows and represents contemporary artists in Chelsea and Shanghai. Invitations and magazine ads we design for the gallery have a rigor established with the use and placement of the typefaces Akzidenz Grotesk and Interstate.

This invitation featured a lenticular self-portrait and painting by the artist.
