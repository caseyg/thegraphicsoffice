TransitCenter, a dynamic alternative transportation non-profit, originates transit projects, provides funding, and is an active player in advocacy. We designed their reports— detailed studies of controversial transportation issues— and conceived all the information graphics. (See our <a title="Transit Center" href="/portfolio/transit-center/"><span class="s1">identity and web work</span></a> for them, too.)
