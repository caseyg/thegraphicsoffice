    digital mural. The figurative tree was laser-cut fabric on mesh. The show’s title
    was handpainted with silver leaf. Photograph by Herb Scher.
  text: We were asked to create something “theatrical.” Collaborating closely with
    exhibition designer Barbara Suhr, we worked on every aspect of the show, from
    drapery, furniture, and window installation, to entryway design and [all printed
    materials](http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/shelleys-ghost-print-and-digital/).
    We partnered with talented writer and painter Anya Ulinich to create a collaged
    _dramatis personae_ of Shelley and his circle.

  text: This window installation incorporated an early 19th-century watercolor view
    of Lake Geneva which was back-lit and framed by period styled velvet drapery.
    On either side were large backdrops of Shelley’s funeral pyre and a Romantic landscape.

  text: Illustrations of Shelley and his circle were commissioned when it became clear
    that available imagery of the group varied tremendously in style and quality.
