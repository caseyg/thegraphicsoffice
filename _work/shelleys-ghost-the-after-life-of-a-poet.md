    digital mural. The figurative tree was laser-cut fabric on mesh. The show’s title
    was handpainted with silver leaf. Photograph by Herb Scher.
  text: We were asked to create something “theatrical.” Collaborating closely with
    exhibition designer Barbara Suhr, we worked on every aspect of the show, from
    drapery, furniture, and window installation, to entryway design and [all printed
    materials](http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/shelleys-ghost-print-and-digital/).
    We partnered with talented writer and painter Anya Ulinich to create a collaged
    _dramatis personae_ of Shelley and his circle.
