      The entrance treatment was a departure from the Library's typical digital
      mural. The figurative tree was laser-cut fabric on mesh. The show’s title
      was handpainted with silver leaf. Photograph by Herb Scher.

      We were asked to create something “dramatic and theatrical.” Collaborating
      with exhibition designer Barbara Suhr, we worked on every aspect of the
      show, from drapery, furniture, and window installation, to entryway design
      and [all printed
      materials](http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/shelleys-ghost-print-and-digital/).
      We partnered with writer and painter Anya Ulinich to create a collaged
      _dramatis personae_ of Shelley and his circle.

      The window installation incorporated an early 19th-century watercolor view
      of Lake Geneva which was back-lit and framed by period styled velvet
      drapery.

      Text panels were made of layers of digital prints of foxed paper with
      hand-torn edges, applied to board wrapped in marbled paper.

      Illustrations of Shelley and his circle were commissioned when it became
      clear that available imagery of the group varied tremendously in style and
      quality.

_Shelley’s Ghost_ brought together objects from the New York Public Library’s Pforzheimer Collection, one of the world’s premiere holdings of material related to Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the Bodleian Library at Oxford, England.
