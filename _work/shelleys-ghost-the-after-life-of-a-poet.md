<em>Shelley’s Ghost</em> (Spring 2012) brought together objects from the New York Public Library’s Pforzheimer Collection, one of the world’s premiere holdings of material related to Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the Bodleian Library at Oxford, England. We were asked to create something “theatrical.” Collaborating closely with exhibition designer Barbara Suhr, we worked on every aspect of the show, from drapery, furniture, and window installation, to entryway design and <a href="http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/shelleys-ghost-print-and-digital/">all printed materials</a>. We partnered with talented writer and painter Anya Ulinich to create a collaged <em>dramatis personae</em> of Shelley and his circle.
