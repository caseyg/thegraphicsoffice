The Associated Press with Lincoln at the First Inaugural and Gettysburg

The Associated Press regularly exhibits historic materials from its Corporate Archive</span>s. We were asked to design the panels (and accompanying <a href="http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/long-remembered-the-associated-press-with-lincoln-print/">booklet</a>) for this traveling exhibition that showcased the AP's coverage of some of Lincolnâ€™s most famous speeches including his First Inaugural Address and the Gettysburg Address. The exhibit was installed in AP offices around the world.
