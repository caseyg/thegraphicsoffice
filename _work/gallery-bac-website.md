Gallery BAC's handsome storefront in Soho, New York, exudes good taste and owner Carlos Aparicio wanted his website to do the same (with a dash of drama). We helped himÂ showcase his collection of early twentieth-century antiques with a <a href="http://www.gallerybac.com">lush, custom Wordpress site</a> that can be updated in-house. The homepage features a slideshow of large photos of highlights, and two different background colors differentiate pages from the top and bottom navigation.
