This exhibition brought together the variety of work by designer Alvin Lustig (1914â€“1950): graphic design, furniture, textiles, sculpture, and industrial design. Doug curated the exhibition, wrote the essay, and designed the exhibition, brochure, and invitation for the Bard Graduate Center in New York. The project was a wonderful collaboration with BGC graduate and designer Rita Jules.
