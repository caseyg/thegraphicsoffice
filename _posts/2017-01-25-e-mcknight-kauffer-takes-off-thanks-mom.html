McKnight Kauffer by <span class="fn value">Raymond McIntyre, ca. 1915. <br />Kauffer was born in 1890, so he was around 25 when this was painted.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Sometimes I wonder if I'm drawn to tragedy. Besides an academic interest in cemeteries and gravestones, I have an embarrassing preoccupation with disaster videos on Youtube. Also, there is my recent idea for giving a public lecture on the subject of design careers that ended badly; E. McKnight Kauffer's career, for example.</div><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Because Kauffer's difficult last years in New York dominated my research, it was a relief to find this joyful letter in the Kauffer archive at the Cooper Hewitt Design Museum in New York City. When he wrote this on August 1, 1912, Kauffer had just learned that a benefactor was giving him money to study art in Paris. Kauffer was ecstatic, overflowing with optimism and energy. In seven handwritten pages, his thoughts veered between thanking his parents, telling his story, and planning the future. His luck made him magnanimous and eager to share experiences with his parents.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Here is the complete letter, touching evidence of a son's love for his parents and the power of a generous and timely gift. (A little background: Kauffer was 21 and working in a book store and gallery in San Francisco when received the gift from an art professor at the University of Utah. Kauffer was so grateful that he added the professor's last name, McKnight, to his name and used it for the rest of his life. Kauffer went to Paris and London and became a famous graphic designer.)<br /><br />Question marks in the transcription below indicate illegible handwriting:</div><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">My Dear Mother + Father -&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Can you believe it, that I’m going to Paris France to study, it’s really and truly so. I’m so happy for it means that now at last the time has come and will be short for our being to-gether for good - for just as soon as I return, we shall make a home and a studio. Now I’ll tell you how it all came about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">oh so</span> sudden, about two years ago a professor at the University of Utah came into the store, we became quite friends and corresponded it seems as though at the very beginning he took a deep interest in me and my work. Of course nothing was said in particular, only that I had great talent. Last year during vacation he came in with his wife and daughter who is about ten years and visited quite often, noting my progress, still time went on and I never gave Paris a thought. He returned again this year and visited a few times and saw my late advancement. Well yesterday he came in and said, “I want to talk with you.” Said he, “Do you want to study,” “You just bet I do,” said I. Said he, “then you will for I can help you.” Well - my goodness, what could I say - my life’s dream come to life, and it seems like a fairy story. Its absolutely true and I will be home for a while to see you both, about October, if all goes well, think of it dearest ones, it doesn’t seem possible, does it? I know Mr. MacKnight well and that it is just his love of art to persuade a talented fellow along. Now of course this is a loan in a measure, that is when I have made good, I pay it back as I can, no hurry nor limited time, just when I’m successful - everyone is so certain that I am going to be a great painter that I know I will or else the way and means would not have opened up to me. He is a Christian Scientist having overcome a great illness. There I know his desire purely that of humanity to progress - and a pure thought, for when I have paid it back it goes to some other struggling youth, who dreams of a great future, such as I have done. I know this is going to make you both happy, for it surely means that at least the sun is shining for us three - I attribute it to Science and my mother’s great teaching to know the truth. God bless you mother dear, you have done it all. and He is going to let us three have the happiest days imaginable. I can’t question your confidence in me, for I feel sure you know and feel that I will be successful, and the money borrowed will be a triple ??? to being successful. I figure on two years in Paris and that twelve hundred dollars or less will the amount I shall be economical knowing full well that in that I’m helping another to gain his point. I shall study right along in my Science knowing that it will point the truth always and always. I don’t want you to ever feel alarmed of the environment of Paris, for that is prevailing everywhere and a strong character knows the good from the bad. I am sure you don’t question that, for I shall always stay the boy you wanted me to be, for I know the struggle that you mother dear went thru. I can see your face just beam with joy when you read the news, for it is the event of events, and the beauty of it is, it is just a loan, to be repaid whenever I can and when I have gained success - Already the art critic from The Call &amp; Bulletin has been in and received my story and also viewed what sketches I have and before I leave S. F. no doubt there will be quite a story, which all helps to make me ???. Everyone is glad. Miss Taylor is away yet and does not know, but she will be too - I give my notice about the fifteenth of August - quit about Sept. 20. I stop over in Salt Lake City where Mr. MacKnight is to make the final arrangements then on to home to see you for a month and then a stop over at Baltimore for a few days, and then the Red Star Line from Philadelphia for Paris France, second class cabin. Write me soon and tell me how happy you are - and know that God is in all things and that there is no room for bad thoughts and that all is infinite love. Life and truth over all. - When I have returned it won’t be long until I’ll want the three of us to take the trip for there will ?? way and we must visit Europe to-gether. As to this loan, it is no an obligation nor will it ever hinder my progress, since I never asked for it and besides it is given with a great heart. No not in a lump sum, but just so much a month will be sent from the bank in Paris. In that way one is sure to keep within the limits. Oh yes the B??? received their ??? and oh so pleased they will write you most likely they said it brought the pleasantries of me whenever they looked at it - Thank you mother dear. I have spoken to several artists of note whose judgement (knowing my works) I rely a great deal on they all say “?????” And that is why I’m going ??? to begin and it through with for yet I’m a young man and think of it two years of good solid study only makes me 23 - I’ll be able to turn my hand to the effort of our getting a home and in the meantime you two do the things you know best and think of a bright near future - I must close so with all my love and best wishes for I love you both dearly (and with my biggest kiss) -&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Ever your devoted + ??? son,&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Ed</div><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; min-height: 14px;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">“This is opportunity and each man at some time in his life gets it, I’ve got mine!”</div><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Here is something I always think of - “The fulfillment of every pure desire is in the hollow of his outstretched palm.”</div><br /><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Write soon</div><div style="font-family: 'Minion Pro'; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"><br /></div>
