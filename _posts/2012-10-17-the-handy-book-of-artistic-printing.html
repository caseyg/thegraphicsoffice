<h3>RESEARCH | WRITING | BOOK DESIGN</h3>
<p>angela &amp; doug</p>
<p>We’re proud of the <a href="http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/the-handy-book-of-artistic-printing/">design of this book</a> but we’re probably even more gratified by the original <span>research behind it</span>. With our design educations firmly rooted in Modernism we’d never seen <span>or learned about anything like 19th-century Artistic Printing</span>. The timing was good to get people acquainted with one of the historical black sheep of design. We explored contemporary moralizing against ornament, and helped place Artistic Printing onto the timeline of design history.</p>
