<h1>THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY</h1>
<h3>GRAPHIC DESIGN | IMAGE RESEARCH</h3>
We helped the N-YHS create and develop a public programs brochure for its seasonal lecture series. The mailer evolved and expanded over several years, each edition involving research in the Society’s eclectic collections of art and artifacts. In an ongoing relationship with several different divisions within the Society we designed many of the institution’s calendars, gala invitations and fundraising materials.
