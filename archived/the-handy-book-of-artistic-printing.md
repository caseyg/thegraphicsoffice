<h1>THE HANDY BOOK OF ARTISTIC PRINTING</h1>
A Collection of Letterpress Examples with Specimens of Type, Ornament,<br />
Corner Fills, Borders, Twisters, Wrinklers, and other Freaks of Fancy

<h3>BOOK DESIGN | RESEARCH | WRITING</h3>
We stumbled upon samples of this elaborate style of 19th-century print design and realized we couldn’t find out much about it. Artistic Printing, the collision of letterpress job printing, the Aesthetic Movement, and ornamental excess, was effectively stamped out at the turn of the 20th century. It had not been thoroughly examined in design history books so we researched, <a href=" http://thegraphicsoffice.com/the-handy-book…istic-printing/ ">wrote</a> and designed the book in order to give Artistic Printing some long-overdue recognition. Princeton Architectural Press printed two editions.
