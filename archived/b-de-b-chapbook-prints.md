<h3>GRAPHIC DESIGN | IMAGE RESEARCH | ILLUSTRATION | PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<a title="Status Update prints" href="http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/status-update-prints/">B de B</a> is a <a href="http://www.b-de-b.com/">growing line</a> of prints inspired by history— read a bit more of the backstory on our shop site. The alphabet chapbook prints, our first line, are based on 19th century children’s chapbook illustrations found in an antique scrapbook we purchased. (Chapbooks were popular and cheaply produced periodicals of instruction.) We scanned and recombined numerous images and letters to make our prints.
