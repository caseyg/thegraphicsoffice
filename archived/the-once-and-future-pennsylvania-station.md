This exhibition, organized by the New York Transit Museum in 2011, described the arc of this fabled gateway from brilliant technological achievement to white elephant, from urban renewal disaster to its possible 21st-century renaissance. We designed the title, color scheme, and all graphic panels. We found the images and created the large wall murals to transform the museumâ€™s awkward gallery space in Grand Central Terminal.
