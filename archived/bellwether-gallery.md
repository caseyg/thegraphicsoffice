<h1>BELLWETHER GALLERY</h1>
<h3>GRAPHIC DESIGN | IDENTITY</h3>
When Bellwether moved from Williamsburg, Brooklyn to Chelsea, gallery owner Becky Smith wanted a graphic identity distinctly different from<span> the minimal look of other galleries in the neighborhood</span>. We created a flamboyant calligraphic mark and applied it to stationery, invitations, ads, and a neon sign, in an ongoing relationship with the gallery. The identity was later recast in silver sans serif and launched on a new campaign of print collateral. (See our<a href="http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/tanyth-berkeley-the-frequency/"> book</a> for Bellwether artist Tanyth Berkeley.)
