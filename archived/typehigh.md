TypeHigh is a line of greeting cards and ephemera we developed that mixed 19th-century ornament and contemporary sentiment. We sold in stores and on Etsy, and the brand was even featured in Stephen Hellerâ€™s book <em>Design Entrepreneur</em>. We printed the cards ourselves on antique presses; it was labor intensive but extremely satisfying.
