<h1>JEAN-MICHEL FRANK IN ARGENTINA</h1>
<h3>BOOK DESIGN</h3>
This catalog marked an exhibition of the French furniture designer’s Argentine work at Gallery BAC in New York City. The magenta accent color has connections to two of Frank’s clients: Eugenia Errázuriz, who showed a similar antique “Inca pink” textile to Elsa Schiaparelli, who then appropriated the color as her signature “shocking” pink.
