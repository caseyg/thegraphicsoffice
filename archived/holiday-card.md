<h1>Holiday card</h1>
<h3>GRAPHIC DESIGN | IMAGE RESEARCH</h3>
How to stand out in an avalanche of holiday mail? Start with a scanned and retouched antique new years card and drop in your own personal message. Then layer on a lacy field of dots. Have these laser cut and voilá—a card that strikes a balance between historical and of-the-moment.
