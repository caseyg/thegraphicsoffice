<h1>DIDI</h1>
<h3>GRAPHIC DESIGN | IDENTITY</h3>
Weâ€™re not sporty, but we helped a good friend design a line of shirts and prints for the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. The challenge was to design something with only typography and color that would satisfy true soccer fans and also appeal to designers (us).
