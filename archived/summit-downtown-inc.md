<h1>Summit Downtown, Inc.</h1>
<h3>Graphic Design | Identity</h3>
The downtown Summit NJ business district is the quintessential small-town Main Street. Vibrant, upscale, it has history but wanted to stress its contemporary relevance and economic competitiveness. Summit Downtown Inc approached us for a logo and a rethink of their promotional materials. We developed an official identity for the downtown council complete with usage guidelines, as well as a more informal stamp mark that can be used promotionally. So far we’ve handled advertising collateral, with a business district capabilities brochure coming up next.
