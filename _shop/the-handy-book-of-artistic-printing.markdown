We stumbled upon samples of this elaborate style of 19th-century print design and realized we couldnâ€™t find out much about it. Artistic Printing, the collision of letterpress job printing, the Aesthetic Movement, and ornamental excess, was effectively stamped out at the turn of the 20th century. It had not been thoroughly examined in design history books so we researched, wrote and designed the book in order to give Artistic Printing some long-overdue recognition. Princeton Architectural Press has printed two editions.
