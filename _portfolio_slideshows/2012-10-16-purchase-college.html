<h1>PURCHASE COLLEGE</h1>
<h3>GRAPHIC DESIGN | IDENTITY</h3>
<p>Part of the SUNY system, Purchase College offers a quality, affordable arts education at a short distance from New York City. For several years we’ve designed printed material for various departments, as well as posters and postcards for the annual portfolio review for high school students. See our work for Purchase College School of the Arts concerts and performances <a title="Purchase College School of the Arts" href="/portfolio/purchase-college-school-of-the-arts/">here</a>.</p>
