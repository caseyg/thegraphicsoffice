<h1>Studio Museum Harlem</h1>
<h3>Exhibition design | graphic design</h3>
<p>Three or four times a year, the Studio Museum Harlem refreshes all its exhibitions at once, with some of the most rip-roaring opening nights in New York. People come for the music and drinks but they stay for the artâ€”and our silkscreened title treatments and didactics.</p>
