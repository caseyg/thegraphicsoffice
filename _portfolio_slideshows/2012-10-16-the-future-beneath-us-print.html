<h1>THE FUTURE BENEATH US</h1>
<h3>GRAPHIC DESIGN | EXHIBIT DESIGN | MAP DESIGN</h3>
<p>This New York Transit Museum exhibition, installed in two parts at the Science, Industry, and Business Library on Madison Avenue and 34th Street and at Grand Central, highlighted eight underground engineering initiatives the city has undertaken. Along with the <a href="http://thegraphicsoffice.com/portfolio/the-future-beneath-us/">exhibition installation</a>, we designed the brochure and invitation and created the stylized map that placed all the projects in relation to one another.</p>
