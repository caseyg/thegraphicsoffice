<h1>BOWNE &amp; CO., STATIONERS</h1>
<h3>GRAPHIC DESIGN | IDENTITY | PRINTING</h3>
<p>Our interest in New York City history led to a fascinating ongoing relationship with Bowne &amp; Co. Stationers, a re-creation of a 19th-century job printing shop that is part of the South Street Seaport Museum. Bowne uses antique type and treadle presses to produce products sold in the shop. We developed a new logo for Bowne and designed and printed dozens of cards and posters incorporating items we found in the museum’s collections.</p>
