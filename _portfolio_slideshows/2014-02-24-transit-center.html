<h1>Transit Center</h1>
<h3>GRAPHIC DESIGN | WEB DESIGN | Identity</h3>
<p>Transit Center asked us to help them transition to their new existence as a alternative transportation non-profit. They will be an originator of transit projects, a source of funding as well as an active player in advocacy. This multi-faceted project includes guiding them in renaming the organization (“Transit Center” no more), creating a logo and brand for this new identity as well as developing a dynamic expandable web site. Phase 1 has concentrated on explorations in naming and creating their current temporary site— a placeholder for things to come.</p>
<p>For the temporary revision of the website, we created a slideshow on the homepage, commissioned illustrations by Oliver Munday, and incorporated a Twitter feed. We retained the existing name, but simplified the logo.</p>
